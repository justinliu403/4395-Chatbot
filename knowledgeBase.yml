football: ["(79) It\u2019s no excuses for Tua Tagovailoa in 2022 (73) Football remains\
    \ an Olympic long shot Posted by Mike Florio on July 27, 2012, 4:37 PM EDT .entry-meta\
    \ .entry-header Getty Images With the Olympics getting started in the same week\
    \ NFL training camps are opening, hardcore football fans have no real reason to\
    \ pay attention to the Olympics (despite their presence on NBC), because football\
    \ isn\xE2\x80\x99t part of the Olympics.", "They would like to see [testing] in\
    \ all sports in the US.\xE2\x80\x9D Even if HGH testing is implemented (more on\
    \ that later), IOC recognition would simply be another step in the process.\xC2\
    \_ Before landing in the Olympics, football would appear in international competitions\
    \ likes the Commonwealth Games and the Pan-American Games.", 'Even then, football
    needs to be played in enough countries both by men and women in order to gain
    full acceptance into the Olympic community.', "There could be good news via a\
    \ recent loss by the United States to Canada in the U-19 IFAF World Championship.\xC2\
    \_ That development comes a year after a team of U.S. unknowns tattooed Canada\
    \ 50-7 in the finals of the adult version of the world-title event.\xC2\_ The\
    \ progress shown by a non-American team shows that other countries may be getting\
    \ better at \xE2\x80\x9Cour\xE2\x80\x9D brand of football.", "Before any real\
    \ strides can be made, the NFL needs to get behind the effort, fully, completely,\
    \ and overtly.\xC2\_ While the league surely supports groups like the IFAF, the\
    \ NFL rarely is front and center when it comes to the inclusion of football in\
    \ the Olympics.", "Yeah, Peyton Manning has said several years ago he wants to\
    \ win a gold medal, and Aaron Rodgers has said he\xE2\x80\x99d like to compete\
    \ in the Olympics.\xC2\_ To get football included in the Olympic games, however,\
    \ the NFL needs to be waving the flag aggressively and unequivocally.\xC2\_ Though\
    \ the league may have some concern about diluting attention to the NFL every four\
    \ years, especially since the Olympics routinely falls within the window of NFL\
    \ training camps and the preseason, the goal of converting the NFL from a billion-dollar\
    \ national business into a trillion-dollar worldwide enterprise would be advanced\
    \ by the presence of the sport in the games that somehow manage to get using caring\
    \ every four years about a wide range of sports we otherwise routinely ignore.",
  There is a much larger love for football in recent years than ever before., "Face\
    \ it, there isn\u2019t enough love for our football overseas.", '.comment-content

    football); it differs from soccer chiefly in allowing players to touch, throw,

    games that were tolerated by faculty as an alternative to more destructive rowdiness,
    the first intercollegiate football game was played on November 6, 1869, in New
    Brunswick , New Jersey , between in-state rivals Princeton and Rutgers according
    to rules adapted from those of the London Football Association.', "The following\

    \ Football.\xE2\x80\x9D As an undergraduate and then a medical student at Yale,\

    \x80\x94beginning in 1878, he dominated the rules committee for nearly three crucial\
    \ decades.", 'Camp was also responsible for having 11 players on a side, for devising
    a new scoring system in 1883 with two points for a touchdown, four points for
    the goal after a touchdown, and five points for a field goal (a field goal became
    worth three points in 1909, a touchdown six points in 1912), for creating the
    quarterback position, for marking the field with stripes, and for proposing several
    other innovations , but it was those two simple rules adopted in 1880 and 1882

    than there is in all of China.', 'Allowing NFL players in, perhaps representing
    their country of origin like in basketball would be good, but allowing only college
    players might make it more competitive.', "I doubt that the NFL owners would strongly\

    8:00 pm .comment-metadata .comment-meta This might be fun to watch one day and
    actually plausible if it was college players only, a la pre-Dream Team Olympic
    basketball and Olympic baseball when it actually existed.', 'Gridiron football
    evolved from English rugby and soccer (association football); it differs from
    soccer chiefly in allowing players to touch, throw, and carry the ball with their
    hands, and it differs from rugby in allowing each side to control the ball in
    alternating possessions.', "In May 1874, in the second of two matches with McGill\
    \ University of Montreal (the first was played by the rules of the Boston Game),\
    \ Harvard\xE2\x80\x99s players were introduced to the rugby game and immediately\
    \ preferred it to their own.", 'When spectators (including Princeton students)
    as well as Yale players saw the advantages of the rugby style, the stage was set
    for a meeting in 1876 of representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton , and Columbia
    to form a new Intercollegiate Football Association based on rugby rules.', "Rejecting\
    \ the traditional manner of putting the ball in play\xE2\x80\x94players from both\
    \ teams massed about the ball in a \xE2\x80\x9Cscrummage,\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\
    \x9Cscrum,\xE2\x80\x9D trying to kick it forward through the mass of players\xE2\
    \x80\x94Harvard opted for \xE2\x80\x9Cheeling it out,\xE2\x80\x9D or kicking the\
    \ ball backward to a teammate.", "After Princeton simply held the ball for an\
    \ entire half in its 1880 and 1881 contests with Yale, both games ending in scoreless\
    \ ties that bored spectators as much as they frustrated Yale\xE2\x80\x99s players,\
    \ Camp proposed a rule that a team must advance the ball 5 yards or lose 10 in\
    \ three downs (plays), or it would be obliged to surrender the ball to the other\
    \ side.", 'Camp was also responsible for having 11 players on a side, for devising
    a new scoring system in 1883 with two points for a touchdown, four points for
    the goal after a touchdown, and five points for a field goal (a field goal became
    worth three points in 1909, a touchdown six points in 1912), for creating the
    quarterback position, for marking the field with stripes, and for proposing several
    other innovations , but it was those two simple rules adopted in 1880 and 1882
    that most fundamentally created American football.', "The new rule resulted in\
    \ the rise of mass plays, an offensive strategy that massed players on a single\
    \ point of the defense, most famously in Harvard\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9C flying\
    \ wedge\xE2\x80\x9D in 1892.", ' Google Tag Manager (noscript) End Google Tag

    greatest documents in American history: 1.', The just-announced college football
    playoff agreement., 'Why is the new 12-year playoff agreement ranked so low?',
  'Sure, the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness thing is nice enough, but only
    the new agreement guarantees a four-team seeded playoff.', 'And thanks to Tuesday''s
    final ratifying vote by the BCS Presidential Oversight Committee, a manageable,
    logical and lonnnnnnnng overdue playoff system makes the traveling squad in 2014.',
  'As recently as the 2011 BCS National Championship Game, a BCS spokesperson gravely
    predicted: "Don''t be fooled -- a playoff would be the end of the bowls as we
    know them."', 'When the spokesperson wasn''t bashing the idea of a playoff, he
    was constantly reminding us that the BCS "got it right again."', 'Yes, it worked
    so well that 11 conference commissioners and Notre Dame''s athletic director gutted
    the BCS and replaced it with a playoff system, a playoff selection committee,
    a national championship game that can be bid out to a non-traditional playing
    site and, eventually, a new brand name.', '"It captures the excitement of a playoff
    while protecting the best regular season in sports and also the tradition of the
    bowls.', A four-team playoff doesn't go too far., 'Despite the BCS propaganda
    of 2011, a playoff isn''t going to be "the end of the bowls as we know it."',
  They're the ones who scored the playoff touchdown., 'Jim Delany, from left, BCS
    director Bill Hancock and Mike Slive came to a compromise to get a playoff done.',
  'The majority of fans will get what they crave: a playoff, with those four semifinalists
    selected by 15 or so committee members who will do much more than just look at
    the final scores.', There is no perfect playoff system., '5 playoff bubble, then
    no whining allowed by the SEC''s Mike Slive, the Big Ten''s Jim Delany, the Big
    12''s Bob Bowlsby, Notre Dame''s Swarbrick -- or any of the commissioners, for
    that matter.', 'Is the playoff system completely fair?']

    of informal, student-organized games that were tolerated by faculty as an alternative
    to more destructive rowdiness, the first intercollegiate football game was played
    on November 6, 1869, in New Brunswick , New Jersey , between in-state rivals Princeton
    and Rutgers according to rules adapted from those of the London Football Association.',
  "In May 1874, in the second of two matches with McGill University of Montreal (the\
    \ first was played by the rules of the Boston Game), Harvard\xE2\x80\x99s players\
    \ were introduced to the rugby game and immediately preferred it to their own.",

    Princeton students) as well as Yale players saw the advantages of the rugby style,
    the stage was set for a meeting in 1876 of representatives from Harvard, Yale,
    Princeton , and Columbia to form a new Intercollegiate Football Association based
    on rugby rules.', '[MOD2] Walter Camp and the creation of American football Harvard
    made the first breach in rugby rules.', "The further transformation of English\

    \ , who even during his lifetime was known as the \xE2\x80\x9CFather of American\
    \ Football.\xE2\x80\x9D As an undergraduate and then a medical student at Yale,\
    \ Camp played football from 1876 through 1881, but\xE2\x80\x94more important\xE2\
    \x80\x94beginning in 1878, he dominated the rules committee for nearly three crucial\
    \ decades.", 'Camp was also responsible for having 11 players on a side, for devising
    a new scoring system in 1883 with two points for a touchdown, four points for
    the goal after a touchdown, and five points for a field goal (a field goal became
    worth three points in 1909, a touchdown six points in 1912), for creating the
    quarterback position, for marking the field with stripes, and for proposing several
    other innovations , but it was those two simple rules adopted in 1880 and 1882
    that most fundamentally created American football.', As schools in England set
    up the modern rules for football that version was called Association Football.,
  'In fact, the MLS tweaked some traditional football rules to make the game more
    appealing to Americans.', "But as the audience grew \xE2\x80\x93 90 million Americans\
    \ call themselves soccer fans, says Courtemanche \xE2\x80\x93 \xE2\x80\x9Cthere\

    of the pitch), to decide how the rules should be applied during a game.', but

  'His real contribution to football, though, was in setting the rules over 15 years
    of meetings with collegiate athletic directors at a Springfield, Mass., hotel.',
  'The game had unlimited players, and one of its few rules disallowed manslaughter
    and murder as methods of moving the ball to the goal.', Each college played by
    its own rules., They intended to agree on the first set of collegiate rules.,
  'The new rules spread quickly, though, to college and high school campuses throughout
    the country.', Football was again becoming popular and the rules were just starting
    to be codified., 'Massasoit House Class Day at Harvard University, 1958, by Winslow
    Homer Three years after the Intercollegiate Football Association met in New York,
    the Massasoit House hotel in Springfield, Mass., hosted representatives from Harvard,

    tailback Rashard Mendenhall noted at an organized team activities workout last
    week that he liked to have a lead blocker ahead of him, the fullback position
    was making a comeback of sorts in the NFL.', '"I think part of [the fullback renaissance]
    it is that you''re saying to teams, ''We''re going to line up and flat-out knock
    you off the ball.''', 'As much as the passing game has become so [prevalent] in
    the NFL these days, you still need that mentality," said Lorenzo Neal , who retired
    two years ago after playing for seven NFL teams and appearing in four Pro Bowl
    in 16 seasons.', 'Despite the proliferation of three-wide receiver and two-tight
    end offenses, nearly two-thirds of NFL teams (21 of 32) opened the 2009 season
    with a fullback in their lineups.', The top 14 rushing teams in the league and
    16 of the top 17 clubs in rushing offense had fullbacks on their rosters., 'In
    2008, all of the top 10 rushing teams had a fullback.', 'Rashawn Jackson of Virginia,
    rated by many teams as the top fullback prospect in the ''09 draft, wasn''t even
    selected.', Three teams have rookies whom they will attempt to convert to fullback.,
  'It may be tougher still when a player has an opportunity to serve as the feature
    running back for an NFL team, then switch to fullback.', 'Another factor: So few
    college teams are employing pro-style offenses, and the spread attacks have become
    so prevalent, that not many programs develop players who project to become fullback
    in the pros.', 'Nowadays, more and more teams at the amateur level are turning
    to the spread offense , which is primarily a shotgun snap.', It's no wonder centers
    are the true unsung hero of every football team., "The rest of a team\xE2\x80\x99\
    s defense looks to the linebackers in a number of ways: Linebackers are the defensive\
    \ quarterbacks and coaches on the field, beginning every play by giving the defensive\
    \ call.", The middle linebacker generally makes the defensive calls (he informs
    his teammates of what coverages and alignments they should be in) when the offense
    breaks its huddle.]
