Project 2: Chatbot

To run this project, you need a couple of things, you need to pip install: chatterbot, chatterbot-corpus, yaml,
spacy, and potentially some others depending on what you already have installed. You can not use any python version
greater than 3.8.X. There is a good chance that you might not be able to get it running though, chatterbot is 
very picky.
